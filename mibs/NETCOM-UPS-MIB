            "A list of alarm table entries.  The table contains
            zero, one, or many rows at any moment, depending upon
            the number of alarm conditions in effect.  The table
            is initially empty at agent startup.  The agent
            creates a row in the table each time a condition is
            detected and deletes that row when that condition no
            longer pertains.  The agent creates the first row with
            upsAlarmId equal to 1, and increments the value of
            upsAlarmId each time a new row is created, wrapping to
            the first free value greater than or equal to 1 when
            the maximum value of upsAlarmId would otherwise be
            exceeded.  Consequently, after multiple operations,
            the table may become sparse, e.g., containing entries
            for rows 95, 100, 101, and 203 and the entries should
            not be assumed to be in chronological order because
            upsAlarmId might have wrapped.

            Alarms are named by an AutonomousType (OBJECT
            IDENTIFIER), upsAlarmDescr, to allow a single table to
            reflect well known alarms plus alarms defined by a
            particular implementation, i.e., as documented in the
            private enterprise MIB definition for the device.  No
            two rows will have the same value of upsAlarmDescr,
            since alarms define conditions.  In order to meet this
            requirement, care should be taken in the definition of
            alarm conditions to insure that a system cannot enter
            the same condition multiple times simultaneously.
